Programming Assignment 2: Conditionals; Exercises 1-2


List of Source Files:

-TotalPrice.py

-Quadratic.py


Code Limitations: Both source files have to be manually restarted when entered improper inputs.

The programs do not loop for the user to put different inputs.

For TotalPrice.py, this occurs when the user tries to enter a negative value for either Item Price or Sales Tax Rate.

For, Quadratic.py this occurs when the determinant is negative or if coefficient "a" has an input of 0.


Deviations from Assignment Specifications: For TotalPrice.py, the Item Price and Sales Tax Rate can have "0" inputs. They have their own unique outputs.

For Quadratic.py, there is a condition for coefficient "a" where the program will not continue if "a" = 0.
